Getting Started with Python</h1>



Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its readability and simplicity, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.


Python has a vast standard library and a large ecosystem of third-party packages, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and scientific computing.
To get started with Python, you can download and install it from the official website (https://www.python.org/). You can write Python code using a simple text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook.


Once you have Python installed, you can run Python scripts from the command line or terminal by typing `python filename.py`, where `filename.py` is the name of your Python file. You can also use an interactive shell by simply typing `python` in the terminal, which allows you to execute Python commands one at a time.


Here is a simple example of a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
``` 
This code uses the `print()` function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console. You can run this code by saving it in a file named `hello.py` and executing it with the command `python hello.py` in your terminal.
