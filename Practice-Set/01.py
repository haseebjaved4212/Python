# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.

a= 2
b = 3
print("The sum of a and b  is:", a + b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

a = 10
b = 3
print("The remainder when a is divided by b is:", a % b)

# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.

a = input("Enter a value: ")
print("Type of a:", type(a))

# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a =int(input("Enter value for a: "))
b =int(input("Enter value for b: "))
print("Is 'a' greater than 'b'?", a > b)


# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print("The average of a and b is:", (a + b) / 2)


# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

num = int(input("Enter a number to find its square: "))
square = num ** 2
print("The square of", num, "is", square)
